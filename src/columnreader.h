  reads and outputs, incrementally, the columns of a .wif file.
  ColumnReader will never output a column of height larger than
  'coverage_threshold', even if it reads in a column of height larger
  than this (in which case discards columns until height is within
  this threshold, according to some critieria) -- Murray Patterson,
  Sept 2013

  obacht : think of some sort of criteria.  For now, threshold is a
  cutoff (that is, it assumes that the preprocessing step took care of
  controlling the coverage) -- murray
